# Data-Analytics-Python
### Python Data Analytics
For the first project, (The Investigate a Dataset project) I was simplyy being introduced to the world of data analysis in python and how to go about it. Nothing really exciting just learning the approach for data analysis in python using one dataset

<This is is about project 2>
This project was my second python project in the udacity data analysis course and it required data gathering (3 different datasests)with different methods used, Data cleaning and data Visualization all in python.
There is are 2 reports , One for data wrangling and the other for data Insights. All files are in the Zip folder Project 2
